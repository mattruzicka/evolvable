# Evolvable ðŸ§¬

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/evolvable.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/evolvable)

**Code Version: 2.0.0** (unreleased)

ðŸš§ **The README and Documentation are still evolving**

Evolvable is a Ruby gem that brings genetic algorithms to Ruby objects through simple, flexible APIs. Define genes, implement fitness criteria, and let evolution discover optimal solutions through selection, combination, and mutation.

Perfect for optimization problems, creative content generation, machine learning, and simulating complex systems.

## Why Evolvable?

Evolvable is ideal when the solution space is too large or complex for brute-force methods. Instead of hardcoding solutions, you define constraints and let evolution discover optimal configurations over time.

**The Evolvable Approach:**
- Explore vast solution spaces efficiently without examining every possibility
- Discover novel solutions that might not be obvious to human designers
- Adapt to changing conditions through continuous evolution
- Balance diverse objectives with communities of different populations
- Integrate evolutionary concepts directly into your Ruby object model
- Generate creative content like music, art, and text, not just numerical optimization

Whether you're optimizing parameters, generating creative content, or simulating complex systems, Evolvable provides a natural, object-oriented approach to evolutionary algorithms.

## Creative Applications

Evolvable treats creative, object-oriented representations as first-class citizens. The same API that optimizes numeric parameters can evolve music compositions, UI layouts, or game content with equal fluency.

Creative applications of Evolvable include:
- **Generative art**: Evolve visual compositions based on aesthetic criteria
- **Music composition**: Create melodies, chord progressions, and rhythms
- **Game design**: Generate levels, characters, or game mechanics
- **Natural language**: Evolve text with specific tones, styles, or constraints
- **UI/UX design**: Discover intuitive layouts and color schemes

## Installation

Add [gem "evolvable"](https://rubygems.org/gems/evolvable) to your Gemfile and run `bundle install` or install it yourself with: `gem install evolvable`

**Ruby Compatibility:** Evolvable officially supports Ruby 3.0 and higher.

## Getting Started

**Quick start**:
  1. Include `Evolvable` in your Ruby class
  2. Define genes with the macro-style `gene` method
  3. Have the `#fitness` method return a numeric value
  4. Initialize a population and evolve it

Example population of "shirts" with various colors, buttons, and collars.

```ruby
# Step 1
class Shirt
  include Evolvable

  # Step 2
  gene :color, type: ColorGene # count: 1 default
  gene :buttons, type: ButtonGene, count: 0..10 # Builds an array of genes that can vary in size
  gene :collar, type: CollarGene, count: 0..1 # Collar optional

  # Step 3
  attr_accessor :fitness
end

# Step 4
population = Shirt.new_population(size: 10)
population.evolvables.each { |shirt| shirt.fitness = style_rating }
```

You are free to tailor the genes to your needs and find a style that suits you.

The `ColorGene` could be as simple as this:

```ruby
class ColorGene
  include Evolvable::Gene

  def to_s
    @to_s ||= %w[red green blue].sample
  end
end
```

Shirts aren't your style?

Here's a [Hello World](https://github.com/mattruzicka/evolvable/blob/main/exe/hello_evolvable_world)
command line demo.


## Concepts

Evolvable is built on these core concepts:
- **Genes**: Ruby objects that cache data for evolvables
- **Evolvables**: Your Ruby classes that include "Evolvable" and delegate to genes
- **Populations**: Groups of evolvables instances that evolve together
- **Evaluation**: Sorts evolvables by fitness
- **Evolution**: Selection â†’ Combination â†’ Mutation to generate new evolvables
- **Communities**: Encapsulate evolvable populations

The framework offers built-in implementations while allowing domain-specific customization through its extensible and swapable components.

## Genes

Genes are the building blocks of evolvable objects, encapsulating individual characteristics
that can be combined and mutated during evolution. Each gene represents a trait or behavior
that can influence an evolvable's performance.

**To define a gene class**,
1. Include the Evolvable::Gene module
2. Define how the gene's value is determined

```ruby
class BehaviorGene
  include Evolvable::Gene

  def value
    @value ||= %w[explore gather attack defend build].sample
  end
end
```

It can then be used in an evolvable class like this:

```ruby
class Robot
  include Evolvable

  gene :behaviors, type: BehaviorGene, count: 3..5
  gene :speed, type: SpeedGene, count: 1

  def fitness
    run_simulation(behaviors: behaviors.map(&:value), speed: speed.value)
  end
end
```

By default, the combine method randomly picks one of the two parent genes.

**A gene class can implement custom gene combination** by overriding the default `combine` class method.

For example, the `SpeedGene` class might average the values of the two parent genes:

```ruby
class SpeedGene
  include Evolvable::Gene

  def self.combine(gene_a, gene_b)
    new_gene = new
    new_gene.value = (gene_a.value + gene_b.value) / 2
    new_gene
  end

  attr_writer :value

  def value
    @value ||= rand(1..100)
  end
end
```

Effective gene design follows several patterns:

- **Immutability**: Gene values should sampled and cached/memoized e.g. `@value ||= rand(1..100)`
- **Self-Contained**: Genes should encapsulate their own logic and data
- **Composable**: Complex genes can be built from combinations of other genes
- **Domain-Specific**: Genes should directly represent the domain

Genes come in various types, each representing different aspects of a solution.
Common examples include numeric genes for quantities, selection genes for choices from sets,
boolean genes for binary decisions, structural genes for architecture, and parameter genes for
configuration settings.

## Populations

Populations orchestrate the evolutionary process through four key components:

1. **Evaluation**: Sorts instances by fitness
2. **Selection**: Chooses parents for combination
3. **Combination**: Creates new instances from parents
4. **Mutation**: Adds genetic diversity

**Features**:

Initialize your population with parameters

```ruby
population = YourEvolvable.new_population(
  size: 50,                      # Population size (default is 0)
  evaluation: :minimize,         # Set goal type (default is :maximize)
  evaluation: { equalize: 0 },   # Supports setting an explicit goal (for fitness to equal 0)
  selection: { size: 10 },       # Parent selection count (default is 2)
  mutation: { probability: 0.2,  # Odds of instance undergoing mutation (default: 0.03)
              rate: 0.02 }       # Odds of gene being mutated (1 gene is mutated by default)
)
```

Supports setting custom objects for the following components:
```ruby
population = YourEvolvable.new_population(
  gene_space: Your::GeneSpace.new,
  evaluation: Your::Evaluation.new,
  evolution: Your::Evolution.new,
  selection: Your::Selection.new,
  combination: Your::Combination.new,
  mutation: Your::Mutation.new
)
```

Evolve your population with a certain number of generations and/or until a goal is met

```ruby
population.evolve(count: 20, goal_value: 100)
```

Initialize new evolvables with the evolution strategy defined by the population

```ruby
new_evolvable = population.new_evolvable
ten_evolvables = population.new_evolvables(count: 10)
```

Initialize an evolvable with a custom genome

```ruby
outsider_genome = other_population.best_evolvable.genome
outsider_evolvable = population.new_evolvable(genome: outsider_genome)
```

Hook into class methods that are called during evolution

```ruby
class YourEvolvable
  include Evolvable

  def self.before_evaluation(population); end
  def self.before_evolution(population); end
  def self.after_evolution(population); end
end
```

Return the bsest evolvable

```ruby
best_evolvable = population.best_evolvable if population.met_goal?
```

Check if the population's goal has been met

```ruby
population.met_goal?
```


[Population Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/Population)

## Evaluation

Evaluation sorts evolvables based on their fitness and provides mechanisms to
change the goal type and value (fitness goal). Goals define the success criteria
for evolution. They allow you to specify what your population is evolving toward,
whether it's maximizing a value, minimizing a value, or seeking a specific value.

**How It Works**

1. Your evolvable class defines a `#fitness` method that returns a
[Comparable](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en//3.4/Comparable.html) object.
   - Preferably a numeric value like an integer or float.

2. During evolution, evolvables are sorted by your goal's fitness interpretation
   - The default goal type is `:maximize`, see goal types below for other options

3. If a goal value is specified, evolution will stop when it is met

**Goal Types**

- Maximize (higher is better)

```ruby
robots = Robot.new_population(evaluation: :maximize) # Defaults to infinity
robots.evolve(goal_value: 100) # Evolve until fitness reaches 100+

# Same as above
Robot.new_population(evaluation: { maximize: 100 }).evolve
```

- Minimize (lower is better)

```ruby
errors = ErrorModel.new_population(evaluation: :minimize) # Defaults to -infinity
errors.evolve(goal_value: 0.01)  # Evolve until error rate reaches 0.01 or less

# Same as above
ErrorModel.new_population(evaluation: { minimize: 0.01 }).evolve
```

- Equalize (closer to target is better)

```ruby
targets = TargetMatcher.new_population(evaluation: :equalize) # Defaults to 0
targets.evolve(goal_value: 42)  # Evolve until we match the target value

# Same as above
TargetMatcher.new_population(evaluation: { equalize: 42 }).evolve
```


**Custom Goals**

You can create custom goals by subclassing `Evolvable::Goal`` and implementing:
- `evaluate(evolvable)`: Return a value that for sorting evolvables
- `met?(evolvable)`: Returns true when the goal value is reached


Evaluation sorts evolvables based on their fitness and provides mechanisms to
change the goal type and value (fitness goal). Goals define the success criteria
for evolution. They allow you to specify what your population is evolving toward,
whether it's maximizing a value, minimizing a value, or seeking a specific value.

**How It Works**

1. Your evolvable class defines a `#fitness` method that returns a
[Comparable](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en//3.4/Comparable.html) object.
   - Preferably a numeric value like an integer or float.

2. During evolution, evolvables are sorted by your goal's fitness interpretation
   - The default goal type is `:maximize`, see goal types below for other options

3. If a goal value is specified, evolution will stop when it is met

**Goal Types**

- Maximize (higher is better)

```ruby
robots = Robot.new_population(evaluation: :maximize) # Defaults to infinity
robots.evolve(goal_value: 100) # Evolve until fitness reaches 100+

# Same as above
Robot.new_population(evaluation: { maximize: 100 }).evolve
```

- Minimize (lower is better)

```ruby
errors = ErrorModel.new_population(evaluation: :minimize) # Defaults to -infinity
errors.evolve(goal_value: 0.01)  # Evolve until error rate reaches 0.01 or less

# Same as above
ErrorModel.new_population(evaluation: { minimize: 0.01 }).evolve
```

- Equalize (closer to target is better)

```ruby
targets = TargetMatcher.new_population(evaluation: :equalize) # Defaults to 0
targets.evolve(goal_value: 42)  # Evolve until we match the target value

# Same as above
TargetMatcher.new_population(evaluation: { equalize: 42 }).evolve
```


Example goal implementation that prioritizes evolvables with fitness values within a specific range:

```ruby
class YourRangeGoal < Evolvable::Goal
  def value
    @value ||= 0..100
   end

  def evaluate(evolvable)
    return 1 if value.include?(evolvable.fitness)

    min, max = value.minmax
    -[(min - evolvable.fitness).abs, (max - evolvable.fitness).abs].min
  end

  def met?(evolvable)
    value.include?(evolvable.fitness)
  end
end
```

[Goal Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/Goal)

## Evolution

**Evolution** moves a population from one generation to the next.
It runs in three steps: selection, combination, and mutation.
You can swap out any step with your own strategy.

Default pipeline:
1. **Selection** â€“ keep the most fit evolvables
2. **Combination** â€“ create offspring by recombining genes
3. **Mutation** â€“ add random variation to preserve diversity


[Evolution Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/Evolution)

## Selection

The selection object assumes that a population's evolvables have already
been sorted by the evaluation object. It selects "parent" evolvables to
undergo combination and thereby produce the next generation of evolvables.

Only two evolvables are selected as parents for each generation by default.
The selection size is configurable.

```ruby
# Configure selection size
population = MyEvolvable.new_population(
  selection: { size: 3 }  # Select top 3 performers
)
```

You can also assign selected evolvables:

```ruby
population.selected_evolvables = [evolvable1, evolvable2]
```
or skip to evolving them:

```ruby
population.evolve_selected([evolvable1, evolvable2])
```

This allows for custom selection strategies beyond the built-in methods.


[Selection Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/Selection)

## Combination

Combination generates new evolvable instances by combining the genes of selected instances.
You can think of it as a mixing of parent genes from one generation to
produce the next generation.

You may choose from a selection of combination objects or implement your own.
The default combination object is `Evolvable::GeneCombination`.

This implementation enables individual gene types to define their own
combination behaviors through the Gene.combine class method, giving you
fine-grained control over how different gene types are combined.


[Combination Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/Combination)

## Crossover Strategies

**Point Crossover**

PointCrossover implements single and multi-point crossover, a common recombination
strategy in genetic algorithms. It works by selecting random points in the gene sequence
and exchanging genetic material between those points.

In single-point crossover (the default), one position is chosen at random, and all genes
beyond that point are swapped between parents. In multi-point crossover, multiple
positions are chosen, and segments between consecutive points are alternately swapped.

This strategy:
- Preserves segments of good solutions
- Enables exploration of different combinations of traits
- Is particularly effective when related genes are close together

Configuration:
```ruby
population = MyEvolvable.new_population(
  combination: Evolvable::PointCrossover.new(points_count: 2)  # Two-point crossover
)

# Or modify an existing population
population.combination = Evolvable::PointCrossover.new(points_count: 3)
```


**Uniform Crossover**

UniformCrossover randomly selects genes from either parent with equal probability
for each gene position. Unlike point crossover, there are no "chunks" of genes preserved
from either parent - each gene is chosen independently.

This strategy:
- Provides maximum mixing of genetic material
- Better handles problems where gene ordering isn't important
- Often performs well on problems with complex interdependencies

Uniform crossover is particularly effective when good solutions have traits that are
widely distributed throughout the genome rather than clustered together.

Configuration:
```ruby
population = MyEvolvable.new_population(
  combination: Evolvable::UniformCrossover.new
)
```


[PointCrossover Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/PointCrossover)

## Mutation

Mutation introduces genetic diversity by replacing genes with newly initialized ones.
This is crucial for exploring the solution space and preventing premature convergence.

Two key parameters control mutation:
- `probability`: Chance of an individual being mutated (0.0-1.0)
- `rate`: Portion of genes to mutate in affected individuals (0.0-1.0)

Common strategies:
- Higher rates early (exploration phase)
- Lower rates later (exploitation/refinement phase)


**Example**
```ruby
# Start with high mutation for exploration
population = MyEvolvable.new_population(
  mutation: { probability: 0.4, rate: 0.2 }
)

# Later, reduce for fine-tuning
population.mutation.probability = 0.1
population.mutation.rate = 0.05
```


[Mutation Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/Mutation)

## Gene Space

The gene space defines the genetic structure of evolvable classes - a blueprint
for creating and managing genes.

**Two Key Gene Count Types**

1. **Fixed Count**: When you specify a single number or default

```ruby
gene :color, type: ColorGene  # Default count: 1
```

2. **Variable Count**: When you specify a range

```ruby
gene :skills, type: SkillGene, count: 1..5  # Can evolve between 1-5 skills
```

**Benefits**

- Declarative model definition
- Automatic gene management
- Self-evolving structure (with ranges)
- Consistent instance initialization


**Example**
```ruby
class MusicComposer
  include Evolvable

  # Define basic musical genes
  gene :melody, type: MelodyGene, count: 1
  gene :harmony, type: HarmonyGene, count: 1
  gene :rhythm, type: RhythmGene, count: 1

  # Group audio effects into a cluster for easier handling
  gene :reverb, type: ReverbGene, count: 0..1, cluster: :effects
  gene :delay, type: DelayGene, count: 0..1, cluster: :effects
  gene :distortion, type: DistortionGene, count: 0..1, cluster: :effects
  gene :flanger, type: FlangerGene, count: 0..1, cluster: :effects

  def play
    # Access genes directly
    puts "Playing melody: #{melody}"

    # Or access gene clusters as collections
    puts "With effects: #{effects.map(&:name).join(', ')}"
  end

  def fitness
    # Evaluate fitness based on musical theory and constraints
    melody_score = melody.consonance_with(harmony)
    structure_balance = structure.count > 1 ? 1.0 : 0.5
    effect_complexity = [1.0, effects.count * 0.2].min

    melody_score * structure_balance * effect_complexity
  end
end

# Access genes and clusters
composer = MusicComposer.new_evolvable
composer.reverb                # Access a specific gene
composer.effects               # Access all genes in the effects cluster
composer.effects.count         # Number of effect genes
composer.structure.first.type  # Access a property of the first structure gene
```

[GeneSpace Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/GeneSpace)

## Count Genes

**Dynamic Count Genes**

The CountGene class handles the dynamic count of genes in evolvable instances.
When a gene is defined with a range for `count:` (e.g., `count: 2..8`), a CountGene
is created to manage this count, allowing the number of genes to evolve over
successive generations.


**Fixed Count Genes**

The RigidCountGene class manages fixed gene counts in evolvable instances.
Unlike CountGene, the RigidCountGene maintains a constant number of genes
that doesn't change during evolution. This is used when a gene is defined
with a fixed integer for `count:` (e.g., `count: 5`).


[CountGene Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/CountGene)

## Genomes

The Genome class represents the complete genetic blueprint of an evolvable instance.
It stores and manages all genes organized by their keys, providing methods to access,
manipulate, and serialize genetic information.

A genome consists of:
- Gene configurations organized by key
- Count genes that determine how many of each gene type exists
- Methods to find and manipulate genes

The genome serves as the intermediary between the gene space (the definition)
and the actual gene instances (the implementation).


[Genome Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/Genome)

## Gene Clusters

Gene clusters group related genes into reusable components that can be applied
to multiple evolvable classes.

When applied, genes are automatically namespaced with the cluster name:
- Access as a group: `evolvable.styling` (returns all styling genes)
- Access individually: `evolvable.find_gene("styling-color")`

This provides:
- Clean organization of related genes (styling, physics, etc.)
- Prevention of name conflicts
- Simplified access to gene groups


**Example**
```ruby
# Define a reusable cluster for visual styling
module Evolvable::UI
  class StylingCluster
    include Evolvable::GeneCluster

    gene :background_color, type: 'UI::ColorGene', count: 1
    gene :text_color, type: 'UI::ColorGene', count: 1
    gene :border_color, type: 'UI::ColorGene', count: 0..1
    gene :border_width, type: 'UI::SizeGene', count: 0..1
    gene :border_radius, type: 'UI::RadiusGene', count: 0..1
    gene :shadow, type: 'UI::ShadowGene', count: 0..1
  end
end

# Use the styling cluster in multiple UI components
class Button
  include Evolvable

  # Apply the styling cluster
  cluster :styling, type: Evolvable::UI::StylingCluster

  # Button-specific genes
  gene :size, type: SizeGene, count: 1
  gene :text, type: TextGene, count: 1

  def render
    puts "Button with #{text}"
    puts "Background: #{styling.background_color.hex_code}"
    puts "Border: #{styling.border_width&.value || 0}px"
  end

  def fitness
    # Evaluate based on design principles and constraints
    contrast = styling.text_color.contrast_with(styling.background_color)
    readability = text.length < 15 ? 1.0 : 0.7

    contrast * readability
  end
end

class Panel
  include Evolvable

  # Reuse the same styling cluster with a different name
  cluster :visual, type: Evolvable::UI::StylingCluster

  # Panel-specific genes
  gene :width, type: SizeGene, count: 1
  gene :height, type: SizeGene, count: 1
  gene :children, type: ComponentGene, count: 0..10

  def render
    puts "Panel #{width.value}x#{height.value}"
    puts "Background: #{visual.background_color.hex_code}"
    children.each(&:render)
  end
end
```

[GeneCluster Documentation](https://mattruzicka.github.io/evolvable/Evolvable/GeneCluster)

## Community

The Community module provides a framework for managing multiple interrelated populations
in a coordinated manner. This is essential for more complex simulations where different types
of evolvables need to interact, such as predator-prey ecosystems, multi-agent systems, or
layered optimization problems.

**Key Features**

- Define a community with multiple population types
- Manage relationships between different evolvable types
- Coordinate evolution across multiple populations
- Access populations and instances through a unified interface

**Example Use Cases**

- **Ecosystems**: Simulate interactions between plants, herbivores, and predators
- **Multi-component Systems**: Design systems where components evolve together
- **Layered Optimization**: Solve problems with different optimization levels


**Example**
```ruby
# A complex ecosystem with multiple interacting species
class BiomeSimulation
  include Evolvable::Community

  evolvable_community plants: Plant,
                      herbivores: Herbivore,
                      carnivores: Carnivore

  def simulate_interactions(cycles = 1)
    cycles.times do
      # Plants grow based on environmental factors
      plants.each(&:grow)

      # Herbivores eat plants and may increase or decrease in population
      herbivores.each do |herbivore|
        herbivore.eat(plants.sample)
      end

      # Carnivores hunt herbivores
      carnivores.each do |carnivore|
        carnivore.hunt(herbivores.sample)
      end

      # Evolve all populations for one generation
      evolve_all
    end
  end

  def evolve_all
    populations_by_name.values.each do |population|
      population.evolve(count: 1)
    end
  end
end

# Initialize and use the simulation
biome = BiomeSimulation.new_community
biome.simulate_interactions(10)
```

## Serialization

The Serializer provides a way to save and restore the state of populations
and evolvable instances. By default, it uses Ruby's built-in Marshal class
to serialize data.

Serialization is useful for:
- Saving the progress of a long-running evolution
- Storing champion solutions for later use
- Transferring evolved populations between systems
- Creating checkpoints to revert to if needed

Evolvable provides serialization methods on both Population and individual
evolvable instances, all of which use this Serializer internally.

```ruby
# Save a population to a file
population = MyEvolvable.new_population
population.evolve(count: 100)

# Save state
serialized_data = population.dump
File.write('evolved_population.dat', serialized_data)

# Later, load the state
data = File.read('evolved_population.dat')
restored_population = Population.load(data)

# Continue evolution from saved point
restored_population.evolve(count: 100)
```


**Example**
```ruby
# Basic serialization and persistence
class EvolutionManager
  def save_champion(population, filename)
    champion = population.best_evolvable
    serialized = champion.dump_genome
    File.write(filename, serialized)
    puts "Champion saved with fitness: #{champion.fitness}"
  end

  def load_champion(evolvable_class, filename)
    serialized = File.read(filename)
    champion = evolvable_class.new_evolvable
    champion.load_genome(serialized)
    champion
  end

  def checkpoint_population(population, filename)
    serialized = population.dump
    File.write(filename, serialized)
    puts "Population checkpoint saved at generation #{population.evolutions_count}"
  end

  def restore_population(filename)
    serialized = File.read(filename)
    Evolvable::Population.load(serialized)
  end
end

# Usage
manager = EvolutionManager.new
population = MyEvolvable.new_population(size: 100)

# Run evolution for 50 generations with checkpoints
5.times do |i|
  population.evolve(count: 10)
  manager.checkpoint_population(population, "checkpoint_#{i}.dat")
  manager.save_champion(population, "champion_#{i}.dat")
end

# Restore from checkpoint
restored = manager.restore_population("checkpoint_3.dat")
```
