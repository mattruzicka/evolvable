## Getting Started

The `Evolvable` module makes it possible to implement evolutionary behaviors for
any class by defining a `.search_space` class method and `#value` instance method.
To evolve instances, initialize a population with `.new_population` and use the
`Evolvable::Population#evolve` instance method.

1. [Include the `Evolvable` module in the class you want to evolve.](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable)
2. [Define `.search_space` and any gene classes that you reference.](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/SearchSpace)
3. [Define `#value`.](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/Evaluation)
4. [Initialize a population with `.new_population` and use `#evolve`.](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/Population)


To demonstrate these steps, we'll highlight the [Hello World](#) example program.

### Hello World

Try running `evolvable hello` at the command line. The goal is to evolve a population of arbitrary strings to be more like any given one.

Below is example output from evolving a population of random initialized string objects to match "Hello World!", then "Hello Evolvable World".

```
Enter a string to evolve: Hello World!

pp`W^jXG'_N`%              Generation 0
H-OQXZ\a~{H*               Generation 1 ...
HRv9X WorlNi               Generation 50 ...
HRl6W World#               Generation 100 ...
Hello World!               Generation 165

Enter a string to evolve: Hello Evolvable World

Helgo World!b+=1}3         Generation 165
Helgo Worlv!}:c(SoV        Generation 166
Helgo WorlvsC`X(Joqs       Generation 167
Helgo WorlvsC`X(So1RE      Generation 168 ...
Hello Evolv#"l{ Wor*5      Generation 300 ...
Hello Evolvable World      Generation 388
```

Let's implement this program. First we define the `HelloWorld` class and **include the `Evolvable` module**.

```ruby
class HelloWorld
  include Evolvable
end
```

Next we **define the `.search_space`** class method with the types of [genes](#genes) that we want for our evolvable "hello world" instances. We'll use `CharGene` instances to represent single characters within strings. An instance with the string value of "Hello" would be composed of five `CharGene` instances.

```ruby
class HelloWorld
  include Evolvable
.
  def self.search_space
    ["CharGene", 1..40]
  end
end
```

The [Search Space](#search-space) can be defined in a variety of ways. The above is shorthand that's useful for when there's only one type of gene. This method can also return an array of arrays or hash.

The `1..40` specifies the range of possible genes for a particular HelloWorld instance. Evolvable translates this count definition into a `Evolvable::CountGene` object which undergoes evolutionary operations like any other gene.

By specifying a range, an `Evolvable::CountGene` instance can change the number of genes that are present in an evovlable instance. The effects of the count gene can be seen in the changes from Generation 165 to 168 in the above example output.

Now we'll **define the gene class** that we referenced in the above `.search_space` method. Gene classes should include the `Evolvable::Gene` module.

```ruby
class CharGene
  include Evolvable::Gene

  def self.chars
    @chars ||= 32.upto(126).map(&:chr)
  end

  def to_s
    @to_s ||= self.class.chars.sample
  end
end
```

When the `#to_s` method first runs, Ruby's `||=` operator memoizes the result of randomly picking a char so that this method always returns the same char from the same gene instance. It's important that, once accessed, the data for a particular gene never change.

After defining the search space, we can now initialize `HelloWorld` instances with random genes, but to actually evolve them, we need to **define the `#value` instance method** which provides the basis for comparing different evolvable instances.

For this program, the goal value is set to 0. This means we want the `#value` method to return numbers that are closer to 0 when instances more closely match our target value. If our target is "hello world", an instance that returns "jello world" would have a value of 1 and "hello world" would have a value of 0.


Now it's time to **initialize a population with `.new_population`**. By default, our population seeks to maximize values. In this program, we always know the best possible value, so setting the goal to a concrete number makes sense. We'll also specify the number of instances in a population using the `size` paramater and change the `mutation_probability` from 0.03 (3%) to 0.6 (60%).


```ruby
evaluation = Evolvable::Evaluation.new(equalize: 0)
population = HelloWorld.new_population(size: 100, evaluation: evaluation)
population.mutation_probability = 0.6
```

For this application, a large `mutation_probability` can shortens the time it takes to evolve matches to short strings, but lengthens it longer ones. This is demonstrated in the example output above by how many generations it took to go from "Hello World!" to "Hello Evolvable World".

Luckily, it's easy to dynamically change configurations such as the `mutation_probability`  by hooking into the following methods.  the following  defining the following class method hooks whcih accept `population` as an argument.

### Evolvable Population Hooks

The following class methods can be implemented on your Evolvable class to hook into the Population#evolve lifecycle.

1. `.before_evaluation(population)` - Runs before evaluation.

2. `.before_evolution(population)`- Runs after evaluation and before evolution.

3. `.after_evolution(population)` - Runs after evolution.


This program uses `.before_evolution` to print the best value for each generation.

```ruby
class HelloWorld
  include Evolvable

  def self.before_evolution(population)
    best_evolvable = population.best_evolvable
    evolutions_count = population.evolutions_count
    puts "#{best_evolvable} - Generation #{evolutions_count}"
  end

  # ...
end
```

In this way, this HelloWorld demo can be optimized by experimenting with population parameters such as `size`, `goal`, `selection_size`, `mutation_rate`, `mutation_probability`. [Pull Requests are welcome](Contributing)

Finally we can **evolve the population with the `Evolvable::Population#evolve` instance method**.

```ruby
population.evolve
```

We've now completed our walk through the fundamental steps to building evolvable programs of endless complexity in any domain.

The exact implementation used by the command line demo can be found in [examples/hello_world.rb](https://github.com/mattruzicka/evolvable/blob/main/examples/hello_world.rb).


## Concepts

[Populations](#populations) are composed of evolvables which are composed of genes. Evolvables orchestrate behaviors by delegating to gene objects. Collections of genes are organized as genomes and constitute the [search space](#search-space). [Evaluation](#evaluation) and [evolution](#evolution) objects are used to evolve populations. By default, evolution is composed of [selection](#selection), [combination](#combination), and [mutation](#mutation).

The following concept map depicts how genes flow through populations.

![Concept Map](https://github.com/mattruzicka/evolvable/raw/main/examples/images/diagram.png)

Evolvable is designed with extensibility in mind. Evolvable objects used such as [evaluation](#evaluation), [evolution](#evolution), [selection](#selection), [combination](#combination), and [mutation](#mutation) can be extended and swapped, potentially in a way that differs from the above graph.

## Genes
For evolution to be effective, an evolvable's genes must be able to influence
its behavior. Evolvable instances are composed of genes which can be used
to implement simple functions or orchestrate complex interactions.

Defining gene classes requires encapsulating some "sample space" and returning
a sample outcome when a gene attribute is accessed. For evolution to proceed
in a non-random way, the same sample outcome should be returned every time
a particular gene is accessed with a particular set of parameters.
Memoization is a useful technique for doing just this. Check out the
[memo_wise](https://github.com/panorama-ed/memo_wise) gem.


[Documentation](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/Gene)

## Populations
Population objects are responsible for generating and evolving instances.
They orchestrate all the other Evolvable objects to do so.

Populations can be initialized and re-initialized with a number of useful
parameters.


[Documentation](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/Population)

## Evaluation
For selection to be effective in the context of evolution, there needs to be
a way to compare evolvables. In the genetic algorithm, this is often
referred to as the "fitness function".

The Evaluation object expects evolvable instances to define a `#value` method that
returns some numeric value. Values are used to evaluate instances relative to each
other and with regards to some goal. Out of the box, the goal can be
to maximize, minimize, or equalize some numeric value.


[Documentation](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/Evaluation)

## Evolution
After a population's instances are evaluated, they undergo evolution.
The default evolution object is composed of selection,
crossover, and mutation objects and applies them as operations to
a population's evolvables in that order.


[Documentation](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/Evolution)

## Selection
The selection object assumes that a population's evolvables have already
been sorted by the evaluation object. It selects "parent" evolvables to
undergo combination and thereby produce the next generation of evolvables.

Only two evolvables are selected as parents for each generation by default.
The selection `size` is configurable.


[Documentation](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/Selection)

## Combination
Combination generates new evolvable instances by combining the genes of selected instances.
You can think of it as a mixing of parent genes from one generation to
produce the next generation.


[Documentation](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/Combination)

## Mutation
Mutation serves the role of increasing genetic variation. When an evolvable
undergoes a mutation, one or more of its genes are replaced by newly
initialized ones. In effect, a gene mutation invokes a new random outcome
from the genetic search space.

Mutation frequency is configurable using the `probability` and `rate`
parameters.


[Documentation](https://rubydoc.info/github/mattruzicka/Evolvable/Mutation)

## Search Space
The Search Space encapsulates the range of possible genes
for a particular evolvable. It is configured via the
[EvolvableClass.search_space](#evolvableclasssearch_space) method
and used by populations to initialize new instances.


Evolvable provides flexibility in how you define your search space. The following example implementations for `.search_space` produce the exact same search space for the [Hello World](#hello-world) demo program. The different styles arguably vary in suitability for different contexts, perhaps depending on how programs are loaded and the number of different gene types.

**Hash**

```ruby
{ chars: { type: 'CharGene', max_count: 100 } }
```
```ruby
{ chars: { type: 'CharGene', min_count: 1, max_count: 100 } }
```
```ruby
{ chars: { type: 'CharGene', count: 1..100 } }
```

**Array of arrays**

```ruby
[[:chars, 'CharGene', 1..100]]
```
```ruby
[['chars', 'CharGene',  1..100]]
```
```ruby
[['CharGene', 1..100]]
```

**Single array for when there's only one type of gene**

```ruby
['CharGene', 1..100]
```
```ruby
[:chars, 'CharGene', 1..100]
```
```ruby
['chars', 'CharGene', 1..100]
```
