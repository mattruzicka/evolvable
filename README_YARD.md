## Getting Started

{@readme Evolvable}

### Hello World

To demonstrate these steps, we'll highlight the [Hello World](#) example program. Its goal is to evolve a population of arbitrary strings to be more like some target string. You can use with the command line demo by running `evolvable hello`. Below is example output from evolving a population of random strings to match "Hello World!", then "Hello Evolvable World".

```
pp`W^jXG'_N`%              Generation 0
H-OQXZ\a~{H*               Generation 1
HRv9X WorlNi               Generation 50
HRl6W World#               Generation 100
Hello World!               Generation 165

Enter a string to evolve: Hello Evolvable World

Helgo World!b+=1}3         Generation 165
Helgo Worlv!}:c(SoV        Generation 166
Helgo WorlvsC`X(Joqs       Generation 167
Helgo WorlvsC`X(So1RE      Generation 168
Hello Evolv#"l{ Wor*5      Generation 300
Hello Evolvable World      Generation 388
```

To start, we'll define the `HelloWorld` class and **include the `Evolvable` module**.

```ruby
class HelloWorld
  include Evolvable
end
```

The next step is to **define the `.search_space`** class method which defines the range of [genes](#genes) that are available to our evolvable "hello world" instances. The [Search Space](#search-space) can be defined in a variety of ways. This example uses a shorthand syntax that's convenient when there's one type of gene. In our example, each gene will represent a single character.

```ruby
class HelloWorld
  include Evolvable

  def self.search_space
    ["CharGene", 1..100]
  end
end
```

The `1..100` specifies the range of possible genes for a particular evolvable HelloWorld instance. Evolvable translates this count definition into a `Evolvable::CountGene` object which undergoes evolutionary operations like any other gene. The effect of the count gene seen in the example output above, particularly in the changes from Generation 165 to 168.


Now we'll **define the gene class** that we referenced in the above `.search_space` method. Gene classes should include the `Evolvable::Gene` module. When the `#to_s` method below is first used, Ruby's `||=` operator memoizes the result of randomly picking a char, so that he same char continues to be returned. It's important that, once accessed, the data for a particular gene never change.

```ruby
class CharGene
  include Evolvable::Gene

  def self.chars
    @chars ||= 32.upto(126).map(&:chr)
  end

  def to_s
    @to_s ||= self.class.chars.sample
  end
end
```

Now that we've defined the search space, we can now initialize `HelloWorld` instances with random genes, but to actually evolve them, we need to **define the `#value` instance method** which provides the basis for comparing different evolvable instances with each other.

For this program, the goal value is set to 0. This means we want the `#value` method to return numbers that are closer to 0 when instances more closely match our target value. If our target is "hello world", for example, an instance that produces "jello world" would have a value of 1 and "hello world" would have a vlaue of 0. Check out the full `HelloWorld` implementation at [examples/hello_world.rb](https://github.com/mattruzicka/evolvable/blob/main/examples/hello_world.rb).


Now it's time to **initialize a population with `.new_population`**. By default, our population seeks to maximize values. For this contrived example, we always know the best possible value, so setting the goal to a concrete number makes sense. We'll also specify the number of instances in a population using the `size` paramater and change the `mutation_probability` from 0.03 (3%) to 0.6 (60%).


```ruby
evaluation = Evolvable::Evaluation.new(equalize: 0)
population = HelloWorld.new_population(size: 100, evaluation: evaluation)
population.mutation_probability = 0.6
```

For this application, a large `mutation_probability` can be speed up evolutionary time for shorter target strings, but tends to be a liability for longer ones. This is demonstrated in the example output above by how many generations it took to go from "Hello World!" to "Hello Evolvable World".

Luckily, it's easy to dynamically change configurations by defining the following class method hooks whcih accept `population` as an argument.

### Evolvable Population Hooks

1. `.before_evaluation` - {@readme Evolvable::ClassMethods#before_evaluation}
2. `.before_evolution`- {@readme Evolvable::ClassMethods#before_evolution}
3. `.after_evolution` - {@readme Evolvable::ClassMethods#after_evolution}

This program uses `.before_evolution` to print the best value for each generation.

```ruby
class HelloWorld
  include Evolvable

  def self.before_evolution(population)
    best_evolvable = population.best_evolvable
    evolutions_count = population.evolutions_count
    puts "#{best_evolvable} - Generation #{evolutions_count}"
  end

  # ...
end
```

In this way, this HelloWorld demo can be optimized by experimenting with population parameters such as `size`, `goal`, `selection_size`, `mutation_rate`, `mutation_probability`. [Pull Requests are welcome](Contributing)

Finally we can **evolve the population with the `Evolvable::Population#evolve` instance method**.

```ruby
population.evolve
```


## Concepts

[Populations](#populations) are composed of evolvables. Evolvables are instances of classes that include the `Evolvable` module and are composed of [genes](#genes) that include the¬†`Evolvable::Gene`¬†module. Genes constitute the [search space](#search-space). Evolvables delegate to gene objects to orchestrate behaviors. [Evaluation](#evaluation) and [evolution](#evolution) objects are used to evolve populations. By default, evolution is composed of [selection](#selection), [combination](#combination), and [mutation](#mutation).

The Evolvable framework is designed with extensibility in mind. The core objects used such as [evaluation](#evaluation), [evolution](#evolution), [selection](#selection), [combination](#combination), and [mutation](#mutation) can be extended and swapped.

## Search Space
{@readme Evolvable::SearchSpace}

Evolvable provides flexibility in how you define your search space. The following examples implementations for `.search_space` produce the exact same search space for the [Hello World](#hello-world) demo program. The different styles arguably vary in suitability for different contexts, perhaps depending on how programs are loaded and the number of different gene types.

**Hash**

```ruby
{ chars: { type: 'CharGene', max_count: 100 } }
```
```ruby
{ chars: { type: 'CharGene', min_count: 1, max_count: 100 } }
```
```ruby
{ chars: { type: 'CharGene', count: 1..100 } }
```

**Array of arrays**

```ruby
[[:chars, 'CharGene', 1..100]]
```
```ruby
[['chars', 'CharGene',  1..100]]
```
```ruby
[['CharGene', 1..100]]
```

**Single array for when there's only one type of gene**

```ruby
['CharGene', 1..100]
```
```ruby
[:chars, 'CharGene', 1..100]
```
```ruby
['chars', 'CharGene', 1..100]
```
