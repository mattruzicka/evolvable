## Unreleased

Features
* Genome abstraction for genes 69afd7c957cbf89cc03b4f3f0ba967bf571c34c5
* Built-in support for count genes 69afd7c957cbf89cc03b4f3f0ba967bf571c34c5
* Add serializer for dumping and loading for population and genogenome objects 9d2a42a29103e1525b3c5471578ee97baeb6e8c6
* Add the following delegation methods to Evolvable::Population ffb9998b09f02fa6759322c324b2f448fd3af223
* Keep previous generation parents for generating instances for the current generation whenever 856ac3a778106d34221ce8ce8ae14b963877dc76
* Add Evolvable::Population.new_instance and methods to Evolvable Selection, Crossover, and Mutation for acting on instances 856ac3a778106d34221ce8ce8ae14b963877dc76
# Add EvolvablePopulation#reset_instances b61cccbee8ac8cc9f00496e5461131bb796af974
# Improve gene class lookup. Suppose you have an evolvable Dog class with a Dog::TailGene class. Now you can just pass 'TailGene' as the 'type' in your gene space definition 079dcef000e57553db8c6e5b89207d2d8e5c9890
# Allow Evolvable.search_space to return a hash, array (when only one gene type), or array of arrays be56c9cc73c7202abc4588cb20c340d1e49498ed

Changes
* Renamed Goal classes. The old, namespaced goal classes will be removed in version 2.0 a3fb1915230cc297e545d873a80f0324bca5833d
* Renamed Evolvable#population_index to generation_index. The The population_index method will be removed in version 2.0 e0251f7c51818c30986d5a9a2b44f3834107ec55
* Rename evolvable_class keyword arg in Evolvable::Population#initialize to evolvable_type and suport strings and classes as arguments. Passing evolvable_class is deprecated and will be removed in version 2.0 and at that time the evolvable_tyoe keyword arg will be required 1491f4b6f5bb615ae17e749922a852edce48072b
* Evolvable::Population.new_instance new uses the previous generation's parents to generate a new instance, if there is one. Otherwise, it continues to randomly intitialize the instances from the defined gene space.
* Renamed Evolvable::GeneSpace to Evolvable::SearchSpace. Using Evolvable::GeneSpace and Evolvable.gene_space is deprecated and support will be removed in version 2.0 837322a66c87d6b3fdf992c1b6c7e1b2fb920fe7

## 1.0.2 - 2021-04-04
